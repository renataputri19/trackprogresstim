## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## SBR Import (Large Files) — Production Setup

To reliably import 100k+ rows via the SBR Excel/CSV feature without timeouts:

- Environment
  - Set `QUEUE_CONNECTION=database` (or `redis`) and avoid `sync` in production.
  - Use `QUEUE_RETRY_AFTER=3600` so long jobs are not retried prematurely.

- Nginx (example server/location settings)

```
client_max_body_size 100m;
client_body_timeout 120s;
proxy_read_timeout 600s;      # if using a proxy upstream
proxy_send_timeout 120s;      # if using a proxy upstream

# PHP-FPM upstream
fastcgi_read_timeout 600s;
fastcgi_send_timeout 120s;
```

- PHP-FPM

```
# www.conf
request_terminate_timeout = 0   ; allow long worker requests

# Size & execution
pm.max_children = 10            ; tune to server resources
```

- PHP (php.ini)

```
max_execution_time = 0
memory_limit = 1024M
upload_max_filesize = 100M
post_max_size = 100M
```

- Queue Worker (Supervisor example)

```
[program:laravel-queue]
command=php artisan queue:work --timeout=1800 --sleep=3 --tries=1 --queue=default,sbr-import
directory=/path/to/trackprogresstim
redirect_stderr=true
autostart=true
autorestart=true
numprocs=1
stdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/laravel-queue.log
```

Notes:
- The SBR import job streams rows and performs chunked upserts; make sure the queue worker `--timeout` < `retry_after`.
- The web request only uploads the file and schedules the job; UI polls `/sbr/import/status/{id}` for progress, even after timeouts.
