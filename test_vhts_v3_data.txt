Test Data for VHTS Version 3 Enhanced Validation

This file contains test data to verify the enhanced foreign guest validation logic.

COPY THE DATA BELOW (without headers) and paste into any VHTS version:

Test Case 1: Foreign guest check-in = 0 but check-out > 0 (should be corrected)
Format: Tanggal | Kamar Tersedia | Tempat Tidur | Kamar Kemarin | Kamar Baru | Kamar Ditinggalkan | Tamu Kemarin Asing | Tamu Kemarin Indonesia | Tamu Baru Asing | Tamu Baru Indonesia | Tamu Berangkat Asing | Tamu Berangkat Indonesia

1	73	146	31	11	8	2	52	0	15	5	13
2	73	146	34	12	9	2	54	0	16	0	14
3	73	146	37	10	7	2	56	0	12	0	15

Expected behavior:
- Day 1: Tamu Berangkat Asing should be corrected from 5 to 0 (since Tamu Baru Asing = 0)
- Day 2: Tamu Berangkat Asing should be corrected from 0 to 0 (already correct)
- Day 3: Tamu Berangkat Asing should be corrected from 0 to 0 (already correct)

Test Case 2: Guest flow consistency test
4	73	146	40	8	5	10	58	5	10	3	12
5	73	146	43	9	6	12	56	8	8	4	10

Expected behavior:
- Day 4: Should work normally as guest flow is consistent
- Day 5: Should work normally as guest flow is consistent

Test Case 3: Indonesia guest validation (minimal changes)
6	73	146	46	7	4	16	54	0	0	2	8
7	73	146	49	6	3	14	46	0	0	0	6

Expected behavior:
- Day 6: Tamu Berangkat Indonesia should be corrected from 8 to 0 (since Tamu Baru Indonesia = 0)
- Day 7: Already correct (Tamu Berangkat Indonesia = 6, but this should be adjusted based on available guests)

Instructions for testing:
1. Copy the data rows (without headers) and paste into VHTS v3
2. Click "Tampilkan Data" to load the table
3. Click "Validasi dengan V3 Logic" to run the enhanced validation
4. Verify that the corrections match the expected behavior above
5. Check that the validation messages explain the changes made
6. Ensure that existing validation rules (Aturan 1-7) still work properly
